Software engineering is more serious and involves applying theoretical knowledge to create something tangible. Software engineering practices are not as rigorous as other engineering fields, but the need for more rigorous methods is increasing. Software engineering includes writing code and using tools and processes to maintain it over time. The book emphasizes three principles for software organizations: Time and Change, Scale and Growth, and Trade-offs and Costs.\nReflection\nAfter reading the book ‘Software Engineering’, I learned about the distinction between programming and software engineering. I didn’t know that they were related but they do different things for the same product. The field of software engineering involves rigorous methods such as running test cases for a program by writing code, which I believe most engineering fields don’t do.\nUse-case By using the skills from software engineering and considering the trade-offs and benefits, I would benefit in shaping up my skills and gain more understanding of it."

It critiques the limitations of structural coverage measures and introduces mutation analysis as a more comprehensive method. This process involves introducing artificial faults into the program and evaluating if the test suite can detect them. It uses a “triangle” program as an example to demonstrate that high coverage doesn’t guarantee bug detection. It introduces the concept of a mutation score to assess the quality of assertions in a test suite. The chapter concludes by highlighting the importance of evaluating assertions’ effectiveness and suggests further evaluation beyond coverage measures.\nReflection\nReading this chapter has made me realize the importance of thorough testing in software development. It’s not just about achieving high coverage, but also about the quality of assertions and their ability to uncover bugs. The concept of mutation analysis was particularly enlightening. It’s a reminder that we need to constantly innovate and improve our testing strategies to ensure the reliability of our software.\nUse-case\nConsider a software development project for a banking application. The application has a feature to transfer funds between accounts. A test suite is developed with high structural coverage, ensuring all execution paths are tested. However, the test suite may still miss bugs if it doesn’t have strong assertions. By applying mutation analysis, we could introduce artificial faults, such as reversing the direction of fund transfer or changing the conditions for transfer limits. If the test suite fails to detect these mutations, it indicates that the assertions need to be strengthened. This way, mutation analysis can help improve the effectiveness of the test suite in catching bugs, leading to a more robust banking application."
